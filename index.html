		</center><H3>Hello There!</H3></center>
		
		<p>
			I am currently  working on a personal website to use as a portfolio, but I decided to spin this app up as an MVP or Minimum Viable Portfolio, if you will. I just wanted to showcase a bit of myself that may not be visible from the technical interview. I enjoy creating little tools for fun as well as exploring technology, and this is an expression of that. 
		</p>
			
		<p>
			 My partner loves movies. She watches a LOT of them, and I don't think I would catch up if I watched a new movie every day for the rest of my life. While I admire her passion for movies, this made it difficult for us to find a movie to watch that she hadn't already seen. She uses a site called <a href="https://www.letterboxd.com">Letterboxd</a> to keep track of movies she wants to see as well as write reviews of movies after she watches them. I figured I could browse her watchlist for something I'd be interested in. Good idea in theory... but she has several hundred movies on her watchlist. I feel overwhelmed just thinking about it. 
		</p>
		
		<p>	 
			 So, I decided to create my own account, add movies I'm interested in seeing to my own watchlist, and seeing if there was any overlap. Letterboxd has a bit of a social media feel to it, so I'm surprised they don't have a feature like this built in. I wrote a quick script, and it turns out that at the time I'd created it, there were exactly four movies we both wanted to see but hadn't yet (I think we're up to eight now). I thought about creating an app so that I wouldn't have to open the command line every time I wanted to check, and because I thought others would be interested in the tool. I reached out to Letterboxd to join their <a href="https://letterboxd.com/api-beta">API Beta</a>, but they never responded. So the code just sat for a while.
		</p>	 
			  
		<p>
			I dusted the old code off and built a web app on top of it just as a fun exercise. Give it a try! Some famous people even have Letterboxd accounts, including <a href="https://letterboxd.com/mscorsese/">Martin Scorsese</a> and <a href="https://letterboxd.com/fumilayo/">Ayo Edebiri</a>. See if there's any mutual interest there. The code behind the app can be found <b><a href="https://github.com/FemiWilliams/boxdseats/tree/main">here</a></b>. I have <a href="https://github.com/FemiWilliams/">other code on my github account</a>, but I do want to put a disclaimer that those public facing repos are in no way comprehensive and were written long before they were uploaded.

			Thank you for reading!
